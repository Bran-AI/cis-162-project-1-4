    <h2>About My Career</h2>
    <p>
        I began my welding journey with a beginner course at El Camino College. From the start, I was captivated by the sparks and the smell of molten steel, my mind filled with visions of becoming a successful welder one day. Within a year, I obtained my welding certificate and secured an entry-level job at a facility that produced intricate light fixtures. I spent a year making light fixtures, and while I was grateful to have quickly found a position in my field, I knew I wanted to fabricate things with more meaning. My time making light fixtures was soon coming to an end. This leads me to where I am now. I secured a position at an aerospace company, fabricating heat exchangers for various military jets and helicopters. Among others, I have made heat exchangers for the F-35 and F-18, and I am currently working on various parts for the Black Hawk helicopter. Every day, there is something new that allows me to hone my skills as a welder. Eventually, I would love to work on parts for spacecrafts.
